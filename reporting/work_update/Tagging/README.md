    10. EC2 tags: 
                 - AMI 
                 - EBS Volumes
                 - Elastic IP Address
                 - Instance
                 - NAT Gateway
                 - VPC 
                 - VPC End_points 
                 - Subnet.

    11. I did research on Services which does not support tagging. 
    12. "Worked on paper prototype. How to visualize tagging data"
    
    13. "Soon I'll be working on adding a tag button. Users can tag resources using this button."
    14. Explored "AWS Resource Groups Tagging API. 
    15. Reaserch Links are available On the miro board.
